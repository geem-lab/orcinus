Very next thing: https://sites.google.com/site/orcainputlibrary/excited-state-calculations/tddft

- Do stunts as function of Theory/Task/Property. First suggestions:
  - DFTB
  - Opt
  - TD-DFT (in the context of UV/Vis of organic molecules)
- Interesting ideas from [here](https://www.scm.com/doc/Tutorials/AMS/AMS-GUI_tutorials.html)
- The panels at the end of step 3 [here](https://www.scm.com/doc/Tutorials/GUI_overview/Getting_started_Geometry_optimization_of_ethanol.html) are very inspiring.
- Some aspects [here](https://www.scm.com/doc/Tutorials/ADF/QTAIM.html) and [here](https://www.scm.com/doc/Tutorials/ADF/Fukui_Functions_and_Dual_Descriptor.html) could be thought in the future.
